/**
 * This is our main class used to run the genetic algorithm.
 * 每一章都需要一个引导类，用于初始化遗传算法，并作为应用程序的起点，用于定义main方法
 * 
 * This case is one of the simplest problems we can solve: the objective is to
 * end up with an individual whose chromosome is all ones.
 * 这个例子是一个最简单的例子，目标是得到染色体是全一的个体(即111111111111....)
 * 
 * The simplicity of this problem makes the GeneticAlgorithm class'
 * "calcFitness" method very simple. We'll just count the number of ones in the
 * chromosome and use that as the fitness score. Similarly, the
 * "isTerminationConditionMet" method in the GeneticAlgorithm class for this
 * example is very simple: if the fitness score (ie, number of ones) is the same
 * as the length of the chromosome (ie, we're all ones), we're done!
 * 这个问题的简单性使得GeneticAlgorithm类的"calcFitness"(计算适应度函数)方法十分简单。我们仅仅需要数染色体中1的数量，使用这个作为适应度函数。
 * 相似的,这个问题中的"isTerminationConditionMet"
